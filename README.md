# Mobility Analysis of The Eurasian Eagle Owl 

This code is for a mobility analysis of the Eurasian eagle owl using hourly and daily distances traveled. 
The analysis was conducted by evaluating gender differences and seasonal characteristics. 
The data used for this analysis includes eagle owls that have been tracked in the area of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany between the years 2011-2017.
